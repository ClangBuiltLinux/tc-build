Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/barrier: Avoid collision with clang's __lwsync macro

A change in clang 13 results in the __lwsync macro being defined as
__builtin_ppc_lwsync, which emits 'lwsync' or 'msync' depending on what
the target supports. This breaks the build because of -Werror in
arch/powerpc, along with thousands of warnings:

        ^
 <built-in>:308:9: note: previous definition is here
 #define __lwsync __builtin_ppc_lwsync
        ^

Undefine this macro so that the runtime patching introduced by
commit 2d1b2027626d ("powerpc: Fixup lwsync at runtime") continues to
work properly with clang and the build no longer breaks.
